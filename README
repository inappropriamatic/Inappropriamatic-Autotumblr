Autotumblr

What it does: Autotumblr pulls a single random image out of your porn folder and posts it.  If the post was successful, it moves the image to a different folder.

How to use it:  change the config path variable in autotumblr.py, then change the config file to suit your system.  Then tell cron to run it however often you want.
